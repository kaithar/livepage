LivePage is a simple cms package designed primarily for easy of use and hosting multiple sites off a single install.

Currently, LivePage is in a development state... please don't expect it to be perfect, because it isn't.

Requirements:
  PHP (tested on 5.2.2, should work on earlier versions.  Please open a bug if you can confirm a specific setup.)
  MySQL
  Apache (may work under other http servers, but no promises)

If you have a problem, please file a bug on http://bugs.the-cell.co.uk under the LivePage project.
Try to include as much information as possible, but don't post anything sensitive (passwords and the such).

This file may be updated with some sort of features list at some point.
